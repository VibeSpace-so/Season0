# VibeSpace Season 0 – Project Submissions

Welcome to the official project submission repository for **VibeSpace Season 0**, hosted at the **Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus Innovation Center**, from **July 14 – July 18, 2025**.

This is the central hub for all projects created during this five-day creative build sprint. Whether you're collaborating through the **Reverse Pitch Flow** or building your own ideas in the **Open Build Flow**, this is where your work will live and grow.

> 🎉 **Speak it. Build it. Ship it.**  
> VibeSpace is not a hackathon, accelerator, or conference. It's a new kind of build sprint, where companies, students, and builders collide to turn sparks into working prototypes.

   - Before the build sprint begins, share your idea in the **[Ideas Discussion](https://github.com/VibeSpace-so/Season0/discussions/2)** thread.
